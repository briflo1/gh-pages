		<h1>BRIAN FLORES</h1>
		<p>My name is Brian Flores and I was born in Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia and
		raised in Key West, FL since I was 5. I moved to Orlando to attend UCF and did so for a few years
		but I was not prepared for a university setting, took some time off and am now attending <a href="http://valenciacollege.edu/">Valencia College</a>
		to finish an AS degree in Computer IT.</p>
		<p>I've spent a lot of time in several majors and have sat in many courses and at the end of the day
		I always feel most comfortable working with technology, sitting on my computer and reading about it
		so it took some self-realization before I made the choice to study computer IT vs the likes of engineering,
		finance, etc. As for what I'm looking to do in the IT field is something I will also be learning as I go
		along in my educational journey.</P>
